# crop-prediction-using-ML

## Overview
Crop Prediction using Machine Learning is a project that employs two popular machine learning algorithms, namely K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Random Forest (RF), to predict suitable crops based on environmental factors. The goal is to provide farmers with insights into the optimal crops to cultivate in a given region, considering factors such as soil type, climate, and other relevant parameters.

## Algorithms Used
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** KNN is a simple and effective algorithm that predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.

- **Random Forest (RF):** Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs a multitude of decision trees during training and outputs the class that is the mode of the classes (classification) or mean prediction (regression) of the individual trees.
