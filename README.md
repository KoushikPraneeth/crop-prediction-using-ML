# Crop Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview

Crop Prediction using Machine Learning is a project designed to assist farmers in making informed decisions about which crops to cultivate based on environmental and soil conditions. The project leverages two popular machine learning algorithms, **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Random Forest (RF)**, to predict the most suitable crop for a given set of input parameters. These parameters include soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), climate conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall), and soil pH levels.

The goal of this project is to provide farmers with a user-friendly tool that can help optimize crop yield by recommending the best crop to grow based on the specific conditions of their farmland.

## Features

- **Crop Prediction**: Predicts the optimal crop to cultivate based on input parameters such as soil nutrients, climate conditions, and soil pH.
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Utilizes both **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** and **Random Forest (RF)** algorithms for crop prediction.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a simple and intuitive web interface for users to input data and view predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Includes data visualization to explore the relationship between crop types and environmental factors.
- **Scalable and Modular**: The project is designed to be modular, allowing for easy integration of additional machine learning models or datasets.

## Algorithms Used

### 1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
   - KNN is a simple, non-parametric algorithm used for classification tasks. It predicts the class of a data point based on the majority class of its k nearest neighbors in the feature space.
   - **Advantages**: Easy to implement and interpret, no assumptions about the underlying data distribution.
   - **Use Case**: Used in this project to classify crops based on environmental and soil conditions.

### 2. **Random Forest (RF)**
   - Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that constructs multiple decision trees during training and outputs the mode of the classes (for classification) or the mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees.
   - **Advantages**: Reduces overfitting, handles large datasets with higher dimensionality, and provides feature importance.
   - **Use Case**: Used in this project to improve prediction accuracy and robustness.
